Discuss: Value proposition: Your will propose a machine learning system that can be 
used in an existing business or service. (You should not propose a system in which 
a new business or service would be developed around the machine learning system.) 
Describe the value proposition for the machine learning system. What's the (non-ML) 
status quo used in the business or service? What business metric are you going to be 
judged on? (Note that the "service" does not have to be for general users; you can 
propose a system for a science problem, for example.)

### System diagram

![System Architecture](./system_arch.png)

** Note- All the microservices are containerised using docker and the orchestration takes place using kubernetes.
Currently we are experimenting multiple text to Video generation models , namely - Wan2.1, Hunyuan video, Open-sora, Cogxvideo


<!-- Overall digram of system. Doesn't need polish, does need to show all the pieces. 
Must include: all the hardware, all the containers/software platforms, all the models, 
all the data. -->

### Summary of outside materials

<!-- In a table, a row for each dataset, foundation model. 
Name of data/model, conditions under which it was created (ideally with links/references), 
conditions under which it may be used. -->

|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Data set 1   |                    |                   |

### Summary of infrastructure requirements

<!-- Itemize all your anticipated requirements: What (`m1.medium` VM, `gpu_mi100`), 
how much/when, justification. Include compute, floating IPs, persistent storage. 
The table below shows an example, it is not a recommendation. -->

| Requirement     | How many/when                                     | Justification |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `m1.medium` VMs | 3 for entire project duration                     | Used across three environments: "dev/staging," "canary," and "production," each operating independent CI/CD pipelines and serving models separately.         |
| `gpu_mi100`     | 4 hour block thrice a week                         |     Fine-tuning different models for text to image/video generation using 4×A100 GPUs.(Minimum VRAM 80GB or higher)          |
| Floating IPs    | 3 for entire project duration, 1 for sporadic use |     Each m1.medium environment instance is assigned one IP, with an additional IP allocated for occasional GPU usage.          |
| Persistent Storage             |             1 TB                                      |     Stores large volumes of images, videos, and model versions generated by text-to-image/video workflows.          |

**Objective:** Design a cloud-native CI/CD pipeline with staged deployment, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and automated continuous training to support the video generation and AB testing system.

---

#### **1. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) & Cloud-Native Design**

- **Tools:**
  - **Terraform**: Declaratively define Chameleon infrastructure (VMs, networks, storage) in Git.
  - **Ansible**: Automate software installation (Docker, Ray, MLFlow) and configuration on provisioned VMs.
  - **ArgoCD/Helm**: Manage Kubernetes deployments for microservices (LLM, video generation, resolution adjustment).
- **Immutable Infrastructure**:
  - All microservices and User Interface (frontend, LLM, video model, etc.) are containerized using Docker.
  - Updates require rebuilding containers and redeploying via Git-triggered pipelines.

---

#### **2. CI/CD Pipeline Design**

**Trigger:** Code push to `main` branch or manual trigger.  
**Stages:**

1. **Build & Test**:
   - Containerize each microservice using Docker.
   - Run unit tests for frontend, LLM prompt generation, and video model inference.
2. **Continuous Training**:
   - **Ray Cluster Integration**: Submit model retraining jobs (e.g., finetuned attention model) to Ray via Argo Workflows.
   - **Experiment Tracking**: Log metrics (e.g., AB test results) to MLFlow hosted on Chameleon.
3. **Offline Evaluation**:
   - Validate model performance on fairness, failure modes, and brand-specific scenarios.
   - Only register models in MLFlow if evaluation passes thresholds.
4. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Deploy to staging using ArgoCD. Mirror production but with fewer replicas.
5. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate concurrent user requests (e.g., 5 parallel video inferences) using Locust.
6. **Canary Deployment**:
   - Promote to canary if staging tests pass.
7. **Production Deployment**:
   - Full rollout after canary success. Use Kubernetes autoscaling for high traffic.

---

#### **3. Staged Environments**

- **Staging**: Low-resource setup for integration testing.
- **Canary**: Partial rollout to detect regressions.
- **Production**: Scalable deployment with GPU nodes.

---

#### **4. Continuous Training Integration**

- **Triggers**:
  - Scheduled retraining (e.g., weekly).
  - User feedback from AB tests (stored in DB via Microservice 4).
- **Data Pipeline**:
  - Unit 8’s ETL processes ingest new user feedback and production data for retraining.
- **Optimizations**:
  - **Ray Train**: Distributed training for large video models (achieves "difficulty points").
  - **Ray Tune**: Hyperparameter tuning for prompt generation (LLM) and video quality.

---

#### **5. Difficulty Points Attempted**

1. **Distributed Training**: Use Ray Train to parallelize video model training across GPUs.
2. **Multiple Serving Options**: Compare GPU (high-performance) vs. CPU (cost-effective) inference for video generation.
3. **Advanced Monitoring**:
   - **Model Degradation**: Alert on AB test performance drops and trigger retraining.

---

#### **6. Validation**

- **GitHub Repo**: All IaC, Ansible playbooks, and Argo Workflows in version control.
- **Immutable Artifacts**: Docker images stored in Chameleon’s private registry.
- **Documentation**: Pipeline flowchart and failure recovery plan (e.g., rollback via Argo Rollouts).
