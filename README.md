# 🛠️ Online Evaluation, Feedback Loop, and Monitoring


## 📊 Evaluation & Monitoring

### 📍 Offline Evaluation (via MLflow)

- **Text-Video Alignment**: CLIP score  
- **Realism**: Fréchet Video Distance (FVD)  
- **Temporal Consistency**: Frame similarity  
- **Fairness Testing**: Diverse demographic prompts  
- **Known Failure Modes**: Flickering, object drift  
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure API validity

### 🧪 Load Testing in Staging

- Simulates real user traffic (5–10 concurrent prompts)  
- Tests varying prompt lengths, GPU load, etc.



## 🧪 Canary Deployment Strategy

We implement a **canary deployment** approach to safely roll out new model versions:

- **Initial Split**: Deploy the new model alongside the old one. Only ~5% of real or artificial user traffic is routed to the new version.
- **Simulated Users**: We simulate a diverse range of user prompts to reflect real-world behavior. These include:
  - Short, generic prompts (e.g., "a city skyline")
  - Domain-specific prompts (e.g., branded content like "Nike shoes on a basketball court")
  - Long descriptive prompts
  - Edge-case and fairness-related prompts (e.g., diverse demographic references)

### 🔍 Monitoring During Canary Phase

- Log **generation latency**, **errors**, and **CLIP-based similarity scores**.
- Sample generated outputs for **manual inspection**.
- Compare canary metrics vs. baseline to evaluate improvements or regressions.

### 🔁 Promotion or Rollback

- If performance is stable, gradually increase canary traffic to 25%, 50%, then 100%.
- Roll back instantly to the old model if:
  - Latency spikes
  - Output quality drops
  - User complaints increase

## 🔄 Close the Feedback Loop

To continuously improve our model post-deployment:

- **User Feedback**
  - Collect ratings or regenerate signals from users
  - Log interaction metrics (e.g., time spent, downloads, shares)
- **Annotation & Ground Truth**
  - Manually review a sample of production outputs
  - Use human annotation or automated checks (e.g., brand compliance)
- **Production Data Storage**
  - Save a portion of prompt-output pairs
  - Label and use this data for periodic fine-tuning

## 📈 Business-Specific Evaluation Plan

While not fully deployed in production, we define a plan for future business-aligned evaluations:

- **Brand Compliance**: Ensure outputs align with visual identity standards (logo, colors, tone)
- **Engagement Metrics**: Monitor share/download rates as proxy for content effectiveness
- **Speed to First Frame**: Measure how quickly content can be generated and published

## 🧠 Extra Difficulty Points Attempted

### 📊 Monitor for Data & Label Drift

- Use text embeddings to monitor **prompt distribution shift**
- Detect visual drift in output content (e.g., style shifts)
- Visualize prompt clusters over time in a dashboard

### 🔧 Monitor for Model Degradation

- Track trends in CLIP scores, latency, and user behavior
- Alert engineers when thresholds are crossed
- Automatically trigger retraining with fresh labeled production data

## 🔁 Automated Recovery & Continuous Learning

We implement a **self-healing pipeline**:

1. Monitor: Log and evaluate metrics in real-time
2. Detect: Spot drift or degradation
3. Retrain: Use recent data to fine-tune model
4. Validate: Run updated model through eval pipeline
5. Deploy: Use canary rollout for safe promotion

> This framework ensures that the deployed video diffusion model remains accurate, fair, and aligned with user expectations—even as inputs, content demands, and business goals evolve.




#### Data pipeline

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 8 requirements,  and which 
optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->
This data pipeline supports a prompt-to-video model, handling data ingestion, processing, and storage for training, inference, retraining. The primary datasets are VidProM (1M+ records), AdImageNet, and OpenVid-1M (1M+ records) for training. Each prompt is modified into 5 variations, generating 5 videos for A/B testing, with the best video stored for retraining. 

- **Persistent Storage**: A detachable Chameleon volume will be provisioned using OpenStack Cinder to store all non-Git-tracked artifacts, including raw and processed datasets (VidProM, AdImageNet, OpenVid-1M), training artifacts (e.g., preprocessed video frames), generated videos, A/B testing results, benchmarking data, PostgreSQL’s data directory, Kafka’s logs, and Spark’s temporary files. The volume will be mounted to the Chameleon instance (e.g., a medium instance with 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM) and detached when not in use, ensuring data durability across instance restarts.

- **Offline Data**: VidProM, AdImageNet, and OpenVid-1M metadata (e.g., prompts, video IDs, image labels) will be stored in PostgreSQL tables. Videos/images will reside in directories on the persistent volume, serving as the “Offline Datastore”.

- **Data Pipelines**: The ETL pipeline will use PySpark to process data at scale, leveraging Spark’s distributed computing for 2M+ records. PySpark will extract data from VidProM, AdImageNet, and OpenVid-1M on Hugging Face, downloading files with huggingface_hub and reassembling OpenVid-1M parts. Transformations will be performed in parallel: videos resized to 720p and images to 224x224 using opencv (called via PySpark UDFs), metadata normalized (e.g., lowercase prompts, standardize formats), and duplicates filtered. Processed metadata will be loaded into PostgreSQL via JDBC, and videos/images saved to the persistent volume. The pipeline will log best videos from A/B testing in best_videos for retraining every 200 ratings

- **Online Data**: A streaming pipeline will use Kafka to ingest simulated prompts, creating 5 variations per prompt in a Kafka topic (prompts). Kafka (running on a Chameleon instance) will queue prompts for video generation, ensuring reliable delivery with a producer (kafka-python). A consumer will process results, logging prompts, videos, and A/B testing data to PostgreSQL via JDBC in tables. This setup simulates production use, meeting Unit 8’s requirement for real-time data handling.

- **Interactive Data Dashboard**: A Streamlit dashboard will be hosted on Chameleon, providing team visibility into data and performance. It will display offline stats (e.g., dataset sizes, quality metrics like % of corrupted files, precomputed by PySpark and stored in dashboard_stats), online metrics (e.g., prompt arrival rates, video generation counts, A/B testing trends), and benchmarking results (e.g., quality scores vs. OpenVid-1M’s 1080p subset).


#### Continuous X

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 3 requirements,  and which 
optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

**Objective:** Design a cloud-native CI/CD pipeline with staged deployment, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and automated continuous training to support the video generation and AB testing system.

---

#### **1. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) & Cloud-Native Design**

- **Tools:**
  - **Terraform**: Declaratively define Chameleon infrastructure (VMs, networks, storage) in Git.
  - **Ansible**: Automate software installation (Docker, Ray, MLFlow) and configuration on provisioned VMs.
  - **ArgoCD/Helm**: Manage Kubernetes deployments for microservices (LLM, video generation, resolution adjustment).
- **Immutable Infrastructure**:
  - All microservices and User Interface (frontend, LLM, video model, etc.) are containerized using Docker.
  - Updates require rebuilding containers and redeploying via Git-triggered pipelines.

---

#### **2. CI/CD Pipeline Design**

**Trigger:** Code push to `main` branch or manual trigger.  
**Stages:**

1. **Build & Test**:
   - Containerize each microservice using Docker.
   - Run unit tests for frontend, LLM prompt generation, and video model inference.
2. **Continuous Training**:
   - **Ray Cluster Integration**: Submit model retraining jobs (e.g., finetuned attention model) to Ray via Argo Workflows.
   - **Experiment Tracking**: Log metrics (e.g., AB test results) to MLFlow hosted on Chameleon.
3. **Offline Evaluation**:
   - Validate model performance on fairness, failure modes, and brand-specific scenarios.
   - Only register models in MLFlow if evaluation passes thresholds.
4. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Deploy to staging using ArgoCD. Mirror production but with fewer replicas.
5. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate concurrent user requests (e.g., 5 parallel video inferences) using Locust.
6. **Canary Deployment**:
   - Promote to canary if staging tests pass.
7. **Production Deployment**:
   - Full rollout after canary success. Use Kubernetes autoscaling for high traffic.

---

#### **3. Staged Environments**

- **Staging**: Low-resource setup for integration testing.
- **Canary**: Partial rollout to detect regressions.
- **Production**: Scalable deployment with GPU nodes.

---

#### **4. Continuous Training Integration**

- **Triggers**:
  - Scheduled retraining (e.g., weekly).
  - User feedback from AB tests (stored in DB via Microservice 4).
- **Data Pipeline**:
  - Unit 8’s ETL processes ingest new user feedback and production data for retraining.
- **Optimizations**:
  - **Ray Train**: Distributed training for large video models (achieves "difficulty points").
  - **Ray Tune**: Hyperparameter tuning for prompt generation (LLM) and video quality.

---

#### **5. Difficulty Points Attempted**

1. **Distributed Training**: Use Ray Train to parallelize video model training across GPUs.
2. **Multiple Serving Options**: Compare GPU (high-performance) vs. CPU (cost-effective) inference for video generation.
3. **Advanced Monitoring**:
   - **Model Degradation**: Alert on AB test performance drops and trigger retraining.

---

#### **6. Validation**

- **GitHub Repo**: All IaC, Ansible playbooks, and Argo Workflows in version control.
- **Immutable Artifacts**: Docker images stored in Chameleon’s private registry.
- **Documentation**: Pipeline flowchart and failure recovery plan (e.g., rollback via Argo Rollouts).
